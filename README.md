# Unemployment Analysis Project
This repository presents the implementation of a data mining course project aimed at analyzing and forecasting unemployment trends across cities and regional councils in Israel. Utilizing a dataset covering ten years (2010-2020), the project applies both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to classify unemployment risk, uncover demographic and employment-related patterns, and predict future unemployment rates. The primary objective is to leverage these insights to recommend targeted policy interventions, enhance resource allocation, and aid decision-making for government bodies and local authorities.

# Project Overview
The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather and clean the dataset, which includes demographic and employment-related information for cities and regional councils in Israel.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for predicting unemployment trends.
Modeling: Build machine learning models for binary classification, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and k-NN.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Unsupervised Learning: Conduct clustering and anomaly detection to identify trends and insights.
Visualization: Present findings using graphs and charts for a clearer understanding of the results.

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

City: The name of the city or regional council.
Month: The month of the year.
Unemployment Rate: The unemployment rate for the respective month and city.
Demographic Features: Age, gender, education, and other demographic features relevant to unemployment prediction.
Employment-related Information: Various employment data points.
Each city appears 24 times in the dataset, corresponding to monthly data across two years.
